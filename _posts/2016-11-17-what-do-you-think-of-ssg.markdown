I think they are brilliant. I've used similar technologies to Jekyll before when I was studying ExpressJS. There I used a technology called Pug to serve static files to the client. SSG's have a good ability in handling traffic surges since serving static, rather than dynamic, html pages places a lot less load on the server. It's less suitable to use in a situation where you would like to display real time data though.
