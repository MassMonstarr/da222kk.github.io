While creating this website I've been using Sass. During this time I've come to like the idea behind it. It allows me to write my CSS quicker. One thing I've been using is the ability to store values in variables and when dealing with colors, there is functionality in place that allows be to create a color based on another color. This is achieved using the darken() and lighten() functionality. All in all it takes CSS to that next level and allows you to do some pretty neat stuff.

I have only begun to explore Sass and since I feel and know that this is a widely used tool, I'm planning to fully master it.
