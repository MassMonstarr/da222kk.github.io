Robots.txt is basically instructions to crawlers. You tell the robots what they can and can't do. Although these rules are not always followed. Since this site is extremely basic at this point in time, my robots.txt is also as such, extremely basic. It allows crawlers to visit the entire site.

Humans.txt contains information about the author(s) of the website. And people who have contributed to it. Optionally you can add some information about the website as well, like when it was last updated.
My configuration contains some minor information about me and about when the site was last updated.
