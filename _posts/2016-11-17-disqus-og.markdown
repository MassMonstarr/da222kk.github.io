To implement comments to my blog I used the technology provided by Disqus. Primarly because I have stumbled upon it before but also since it was recommended and had such easy implementation.

Open Graph is very neat. When sharing a page on for example Twitter, some information about the page follows with it according to your configuration. This can be an image, a snippet of text... etc.
